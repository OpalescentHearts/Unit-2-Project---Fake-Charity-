      <p class="article">The Oceans Promotion is a charity dedicated to the expansion of the Ocean.
        <br> 
        The founder "Bob" has stated "The expansion of our ocean is the most beneficial thing we can do for the environment. 
        <br>
         Now that global warming is already in full swing we should use it to our advantage." 
        <br>
        The charity seems to fully believe that the earth would be a much better place if it were entirely covered in water.   
        <br>
        Many of the charity's volunteers have stated that they hope to see a day when the world is in a better state and believe this is the only way to accomplish that.</p></div>
